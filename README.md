## 📌 Business Problem Statement
The CMS Open Payments Program mandates healthcare companies to publicly report financial transfers to physicians. In 2018, over $9 billion was exchanged. This project analyzes these financial relationships to identify payment patterns, cluster behaviors into risk-profiles, and predict payment valuations based on physician and company characteristics.

## 🧠 Economic & Financial Concepts Applied
- **Demand & Supply**: High-demand medical specialties attract higher consulting and speaking payments.
- **Information Asymmetry**: Data aggregation creates transparency, bridging the gap between pharmaceutical influence and public knowledge.
- **Moral Hazard**: Strong financial ties carry the risk of influencing physician prescribing behavior.
- **Price Discovery (Regression)**: Modeling benchmarks the "fair market value" of compensation for physician services.

## 🤖 AI Techniques Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Trend analysis and specialty payment breakdown.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting industry-physician financial relationships into behavioral groups.
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting total payment amounts using statistical features.
